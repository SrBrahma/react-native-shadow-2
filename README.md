# react-native-shadow-2

[react-native-shadow](https://github.com/879479119/react-native-shadow) is dead for years. This one is an improved version with more functionalities, Typescript support and written from scratch. Also, it doesn't require the usage of the `size` property: the shadow is smartly applied on the first render and then precisely reapplied on the following renders.

It solves the old React Native issue of not having the same shadow appearence and implementation for Android, iOS and Web.

The [ethercreative/react-native-shadow-generator](https://ethercreative.github.io/react-native-shadow-generator) website won't give you very similar results between the two platforms, for the reasons I described [here](https://github.com/ethercreative/react-native-shadow-generator/issues/2#issuecomment-738130722), when I started to think more seriously about this shadow issue.

Compatible with Android, iOS and Web. **And Expo!**

## Properties

#### All properties are optional.

<!--$shadowProperties-->

| Property | Description | Type | Default
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| **startColor** | The color of the shadow when it's right next to the given content, leaving it. Accepts alpha channel. | `string` | `'#00000020'`
| **finalColor** | The color of the shadow at the maximum distance from the content. Accepts alpha channel. | `string` | Transparent color of startColor. [Explanation](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/31#issuecomment-985578972)
| **distance** | How far the shadow goes. | `number` | `10`
| **radius** | The radius of each corner of your child component. Passing a number will apply it to all corners.<br/><br/>If passing an object, `undefined` corners will have the radius of the `default` property if defined.<br/><br/>If `undefined`, it will try to get `viewStyle` radii if **`getViewStyleRadius`**, and then child's view style radii if **`getChildRadius`**, both true as default.<br/><br/>Each corner fallbacks to 0. | `number \| { default?: number ; topLeft?: number ; topRight?: number ; bottomLeft?: number ; bottomRight?: number  }` | `undefined`
| **offset** | Moves the shadow. Negative `x` moves it left, negative `y` moves it up.<br/><br/>Accepts `'x%'` values, in relation to the child's size.<br/><br/>Setting an offset will default `paintInside` to true, as it's usually the desired behaviour. | `[x: string \| number, y: string \| number]` | `[0, 0]`
| **paintInside** | If the shadow should be applied inside the external shadows, below the child. `startColor` is used as fill color.<br/><br/>Useful when using `offset` or if your child has some transparency. | `boolean` | `false`, but `true` if `offset` is defined
| **sides** | The sides that will have their shadows drawn. Doesn't include corners. | `("left" \| "right" \| "top" \| "bottom")[]` | `['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom']`
| **corners** | The corners that will have their shadows drawn. | `("topLeft" \| "topRight" \| "bottomLeft" \| "bottomRight")[]` | `['topLeft', 'topRight', 'bottomLeft', 'bottomRight']`
| **size** | If you don't want the 2 renders of the shadow (1st applies the relative positioning and sizing that may contain a quick pixel gap, 2nd uses exact pixel size from onLayout), you may want to use this. Using this won't trigger the onLayout on 2nd render and beyond, as the values entered here are already precisely rounded and are equal to the onLayout values.<br/><br/>You may want to set `backgroundColor` in the `viewStyle` property for your child background color.<br/><br/>Useful for animations. | `[width: number, height: number]` | `undefined`
| **safeRender** | If you don't want the relative sizing and positioning of the shadow on the 1st render but only on the 2nd render and beyond with the exact onLayout sizes. Useful if dealing with radii greater than the sides sizes, to avoid visual artifacts on the first render.<br/><br/>When `true`, the shadow only appears after the first render, where it's invisible. | `boolean` | `false`
| **viewStyle** | The style of the view that wraps your child component.<br/><br/>If using the `size` property, this wrapping view will automatically receive as style the `size` values and the radiuses from the `radius` property or from the child, if `getChildRadius`. | `StyleProp<ViewStyle>` | `undefined`
| **containerViewStyle** | The style of the view that contains the shadow and your child component. | `StyleProp<ViewStyle>` | `undefined`
| **getChildRadius** | If it should try to get the radii from the child's view `style` if our `radius` property is `undefined`. It gets the values of each corner, like `borderTopLeftRadius` and `borderRadius` as fallback for all corners.<br/><br/>The corners defined in `viewStyle` have priority over child's view style, if **`getViewStyleRadius`**. | `boolean` | `true`
| **getViewStyleRadius** | If it should try to get the radii from the `viewStyle` if `radius` property is `undefined`. It gets the values of each corner, like `borderTopLeftRadius` and `borderRadius` as fallback for all corners.<br/><br/>The corners defined in `viewStyle` have priority over child's view style, if **`getViewStyleRadius`**. | `boolean` | `true`

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è FAQ

**Q**: How to set the Shadow opacity?

**A**: The opacity in react-native-shadow-2, differently from the "original" version, is set directly at the `startColor` and `finalColor` properties, in the alpha channel. E.g.: `'#0001'` would be an almost transparent black. You may also use `'#rrggbbaa'`, `'rgba()'`, `'hsla()'` etc. [All patterns in this link, but not int colors, are accepted](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors).


**Q**: [My component is no longer using the available parent width after applying the Shadow! What to do?](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/7#issuecomment-899764882)

**A**: Use `viewStyle={{alignSelf: 'stretch'}}` in your Shadow component. Explanation in link above!


**Q**: I want a preset for my Shadows, so I don't have to type the same props among them and I want to quickly change them all if I want to!

**A**: This package exports the `ShadowProps` type, that are the props of the Shadow component. You may do the following:
```tsx
export const ShadowPresets = {
  button: {
    offset: [0, 1], distance: 1, startColor: '#0003',
  } as ShadowProps,
};
```
and then in your Shadow component:
```tsx
<Shadow {...ShadowPresets.button}>
```

**Q**: The `offset` and `size` properties are throwing Typescript errors!

**A**: Upgrade your Typescript to at least 4.0.0! Those two properties use [**labeled tuples**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-0.html#labeled-tuple-elements). If you don't use Typescript, this won't happen.

## üêõ Notes / Known Issues

* [Setting (or obtaining from the child) a too high `radius` (`> size/2`) will mess the shadow.](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/15)
**Update v5:** The radius is now properly limited on the 2nd render and beyond! You may use the safeRender to don't render the shadow until this 2nd render, when the onLayout happens and we get the exact sizes to apply this limit.
