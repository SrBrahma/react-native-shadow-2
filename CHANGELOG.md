### 7.0.8 - 2023-05-15

- Fixed issue when the child size would change only one of its axis. [#72](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/72).
- As a minor performance improvement, now sides will only be rendered if they are known to be visible. Before, if your height was X and the topStart and bottomStart radii were each X/2, the left side would still be rendered even it having the size 0.

### 7.0.7 - 2023-04-14

- Fixed X offset not working in iOS. [#65](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/65), [#67](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/67). Many thanks, [dmdmd](https://github.com/dmdmd) and [Youssef Henna](https://github.com/YoussefHenna)!

### 7.0.6 - 2022-09-26

- Add react-native-svg v13 support. [#58](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/pull/58). Thanks, [@Vin-Xi](https://github.com/Vin-Xi)!

### 7.0.5 - 2022-08-15

- Fixed inner circle of corners being black. [#56 (comment)](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/56#issuecomment-1214805252).
- Fixed the outer part of corners not being cropped. [#56 (comment)](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/56#issuecomment-1214805252). Thanks once again, [alexco2](https://github.com/alexco2)!
- setChildLayoutWidth/height will now only be called if the sizes **in pixels** changed, ignoring useless re-renders due to very small changes in the values that wouldn't change the result.

### 7.0.4 - 2022-08-14

- Fixed Android's `The argument must be a React element, but you passed null.` error. [#56](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/56). Thanks again, [alexco2](https://github.com/alexco2)!

### 7.0.3 - 2022-08-14

- Fixed `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'd.width')` error. [#56](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/56). Thanks, [alexco2](https://github.com/alexco2)!
- Fixed `flex-start` not being the default `alignSelf` style as it was before.

### 7.0.2 - 2022-08-10

- Fixed missing `version` const export in `index.tsx`.

### 7.0.1 - 2022-08-10

- Added missing `import React from 'react'`.

# 7.0.0 - 2022-08-10

> Major changes to improve the performance, simplify the library usage and improve the Developer Experience. An important update that consolidates this library's maturity.

### Features

- `stretch` property - [#7](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/7#issuecomment-899784537).
- `disabled` property - Easy and performance-friendly way to disable the shadow (but to keep rendering the children).
- `containerViewProps` property.
- `childrenViewProps` property.

### Changes

- Renamed `viewStyle` to `style`.
- Renamed `containerViewStyle` to `containerStyle`.
- Renamed `finalColor` to `endColor`, to follow the `start/end` pattern of the following change.
- `left` / `right` in `sides` and `corners` were changed to `start` / `end` for [RTL friendliness](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2016/08/19/right-to-left-support-for-react-native-apps)
- `sides` and `corners` properties are now objects instead of arrays.

  > Note that you may still use `borderTopLeftRadius` etc in `style` besides `borderTopStartRadius` if you want to.

### Removals

<ul>
<li><code>size</code> property. The size now can only be defined in the Shadow's or child's <code>style</code>'s <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties.</li>
<li><code>radius</code> property. The radii now can only be defined in the Shadow's or child's <code>style</code>'s <code>borderRadius</code> related properties, such as <code>borderTopStartRadius</code>/<code>borderTopLeftRadius</code> etc.</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary><code>getChildRadius</code> and <code>getViewStyleRadius</code>.</summary>
Properties removed for the sake of simplicity of this package. Probably no one used them anyway. If you did use them and want or need them, open an issue about it with your use case. They are always active now. Before, they were active by default.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

### Improvements

- Significant performance and RAM usage due to general refactorings, SVGs' simplification (with the same appearance), improved memoizations and micro performance improvements.
- Now using `colord` package instead of `polished` to deal with colors' alpha.

### Fixes

- [RTL in web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/issues/2350#issuecomment-1193642853).
- Error when there is more than a child. [#38](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/38)
- Error when there isn't a child. [#38 (comment)](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/38#issuecomment-1059716569)
- Situational 1-pixel overlap of corners.

## 6.0.6 - 2022-07-21

- Fixed Web Shadow when there are more than one being rendered. [#53](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/53). Many thanks, [@GreyJohnsonGit](https://github.com/GreyJohnsonGit)!

## 6.0.5 - 2022-05-01

- Fixed Android crash when `distance` and a radius are both 0. [#47](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/47). Many thanks, [@Czino](https://github.com/Czino)!

## 6.0.4 - 2022-04-12

- Fixed missed children type when using the new @types/react 18. [#44](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/44). Thanks [@Czino](https://github.com/Czino) and [@hcharley](https://github.com/hcharley)!

## 6.0.3 - 2022-02-11

- Fixed paintInside gaps on iOS. [#36](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/36). Thanks, [@walterholohan](https://github.com/walterholohan)!

## 6.0.2 - 2022-01-26

- Changed `react-native-svg` peerDep version from `'*'` to `'^12.1.0'` to warn users using older and certainly incompatible versions.
- Added `version` export, the package semver version.

## 6.0.1 - 2022-01-16

- Fixed topRight corner using bottomRight radius on its positioning instead its own radius. [#33](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/pull/33). Thanks, [@timqha](https://github.com/timqha)!

## 6.0.0 - 2022-01-03

- Changed finalColor default to **transparent startColor** instead of `#000`. This results in a better gradient when startColor isn't black. [Explanation](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/31#issuecomment-985578972). As this (unlikely) may lead to unexpected visual results in your app, made this version a major.
- Changed shadow wrapping View style from `width: '100%', height: '100%', position: 'absolute',` to `...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject`. This fixed a strange overflowing shadow on the first render that happened in some specific case.
- Added `pointerEvents='none'` to the shadow wrapping view. Thanks, [OriErel](https://github.com/OriErel)! [#32](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/pull/32)
- Added `shadowViewProps` property to set additional properties to the shadow wrapping view. [#32](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/pull/32)
- **tsconfig** - `module` from `commonjs` to `es6`, `jsx` from `react` to `react-native`, added `esModuleInterop: true`

## 5.1.2 - 2021-11-07

- Changed tsconfig target from `esnext` to `es6`. [#29](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/29)

## 5.1.1 - 2021-10-27

- Fixed the multi-children error being raised when > 1 child but `radius={0}`.

## 5.1.0 - 2021-10-02

- This package now supports [RTL](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2016/08/19/right-to-left-support-for-react-native-apps). [#26](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/26). Thanks [@abdullahkn287](abdullahkn287) and [@serzh-f](https://github.com/serzh-f)!
- [Web] - Removed `shape-rendering: 'crispEdges'` from the SVG parts as since 5.0.0 the Web shadow is pixel perfect (by properly rounding the sizes) and this previous semi-solution is no longer needed.

## 5.0.0 - 2021-09-19

- Renamed `getChildRadiusStyle` property to `getChildRadius`.
- Each corner radius is now limited using [this](https://css-tricks.com/what-happens-when-border-radii-overlap/). The link is for CSS but works in the same way for mobile. [#15](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/15). Thanks for the limit suggestion, [@jimmi-joensson](https://github.com/jimmi-joensson)!
- Added safeRender property to only render on the 2nd render and beyond -- so, no relative rendering on the first render. This is useful when you want a pill/circle like shadow and you are inputting a radius greater than the corresponding sizes. On the future there may be a prop specific for those cases to have them working right on the first render.
- In web looks like it's now completly free from the pixel gaps/overlaps on the 2nd render and beyond!
- Added pointerEvents='box-none' to the container and content views, so clicks/presses go through them and your child may receive them. [#24](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/24). Thanks, [@AdamSheaHewett](https://github.com/AdamSheaHewett)
- Fixed onLayout changes not taking effect when `size` prop was true then switched to false and then a new render was made.

## 4.1.0 - 2021-08-28

- Added `getViewStyleRadius`. [#19](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/19). Thanks [@rbozan](https://github.com/rbozan)!
- Added support for `borderTopStartRadius`, `borderTopEndRadius`, `borderBottomStartRadius`, `borderTopStartRadius` in `getChildRadiusStyle` and in the new `getViewStyleRadius`. Before, only `left, right, top, bottom` combinations were supported.
- Code improvements.
- Added `types` to package.json to display `TypeScript Types` in https://reactnative.directory. - [react-native-community/directory #707](https://github.com/react-native-community/directory/pull/707#issuecomment-906719165). Thanks, [@Simek](https://github.com/Simek)!

### NOTE: `getChildRadiusStyle` will be renamed to `getChildRadius` at the next major.

### Sandbox

- Now using @sharcoux/slider instead of @react-native-community/slider

## 4.0.0 - 2021-08-16

Not too many changes here, but they require a major semver change. It implements [#13](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2/issues/13)

- `paintInside` now defaults to true **if** the `offset` property is defined. Else, it keeps its default to false;
- Changed `viewStyle` type from `ViewStyle` to `StyleProp<ViewStyle>`. Thanks, [jimmi-joensson](https://github.com/jimmi-joensson)!
- Renamed ShadowI to ShadowProps

## 3.0.0 - 2021-07-17

- **Shadow with automatic size is applied on the same render!**. Lib rewritten to allow it. 1 month of pure suffering and despair trying to find new html/svg/react hacks to do what I wanted. :') #7, #8, #9,
- Now it works on Web (React Native Web / Expo)
- Added `getChildRadius` prop.
- Added `paintInside` prop.
- Added `viewStyle` prop.
- Removed `contentViewStyle` prop.
- Changed default `startColor` from `'#00000010'` to `'#00000020'`, so it's more noticeable when first trying the lib.
- Looks like the pixel gaps/overlaps are all solved. It was a very long and frustrating marathon to achieve this!
- [code] Added a partial README filler, using [this](https://github.com/tgreyuk/typedoc-plugin-markdown/issues/59#issuecomment-867300957) (mine!)
- Added Sandbox! Used it a lot while developing this lib.
- Changed minor functionalities
- Minor fixes

> We are calling this 3.0.0 because 2.0.0 would be ambiguous. One could think that the 1.0.0 is a reference to the original react-native-shadow package and the 2.0.0 would just be the react-native-shadow-2.

### 1.1.1 - 2021-03-23

- Fixed sides shadow position when not having top/left side shadow.

## 1.1.0 - 2021-03-06

- Added offset
